fetproxy is a tool for connecting gdb to an MSP430 debugger.

Current status: fetproxy is still under development, and currently is
not capable of debugging any devices.

In the future, fetproxy should be able to:
 - Program and debug all msp430 devices, including the 5xx range
 - Use the advanced debugging features exposed by the EEM 
 - Use the mailbox peripheral in the 5xx range

A timeframe for the completion of this work is not available.  Work is
done on fetproxy in an unscheduled manner in the spare time of the
authors.

If you would like to get in contact with the authors, e.g. to submit a
patch, then send an email to Rob Spanton <rspanton@zepler.net>.  A
mailing list may develop soon.
